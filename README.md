# Redirections

This repository is simply a collection of redirections that are associated with me. I use this to these target links easier to remember and share (they also don't look as suspicious).

## How it works?

Each redirection is an `index.html` file in the corresponding directory (which ends up being the path or 'name' of the redirection). That file contains a meta tag that redirects the user to the target link, as well as JavaScript code that does the same thing if the meta tag somehow fails to work.
